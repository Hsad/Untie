		"Anton: “We need to build a public presence, to unveil the unrest bubbling below the placid veneer of society. Track down sites of Cheskovan oppression and deface them. Let the dogs know that there are those who will not accept their rule, and show the people that they need not repress their true beliefs.”,
		"You: “Yes, sir.”,
		"Anton: You have failed us you made us look like lunatics!!!!",
		"You: “The list is complete.”,
		"Anton: “Good. I’ll send the targets to some men immediately.",
		"Anton: Come on are you part of us or not stop messing up!",
		"Anton: Good work on the raid we got a lot of supplies, and by goodness that was just the amount of weapons we needed.",
		"You: For the revolution, and the future.",
		"Ivan: we lost a great many a person in that raid"
	],
	"part2":[	
		"Anton: Good work now with cars we can go resupply our men and reach the front lines faster.",
		"You: Thank you, it was my honor to aid the revolution in the best possible way. ",
		"You: “I’ve compiled the sources. Expect them within the day.”,
		"Ivan: Good. Before making an army, you must feed an army. Take care, comrade.”
		"Ivan: If this is the extent of your abilities, I have overestimated you",
		"You: Sorry sir this will never happen again",
		"Ivan: Great work we now have a great power on our side. Alas it shows us how greedy and foolish this government is to be so easily bribed.",
		"You: Thank you, it wasn't much the man was always a greedy little guy.",
		"Ivan: That much money and he still didn't join that greedy pig, and I thought we had enough money to get him on our side.",
		"Ivan: Thanks you, we got some good intel, Let's hope this can help us and protect the civilians.",
		"Ivan: No Intel? This makes it harder",
		"Ivan: Good work on the raid",
		"Anton: We lost too many and gained too few"
	],
	"part3":[
		"Ivan: great job hustling that money my boy, We neded some funds to help initiate our movement.",
		"You: it was nothing, for the glory of the revolution we can always pay them back later.",
		"Ivan: can't even hustle a couple of boys you've been slacking, we need funds don't forget that money is needed to fund an operation.",
		"You: It will ever happen again.",
		"Anton: That was a tremendous success great work!! Now the government knows we mean buisness. We must take the intitative while we still have it.",
		"You: If only there weren't any civilians nearby. Is it really worth it Anton? The amount of people that have been hurt, are we really doing the right thing?",
		"Anton: YOU FOOL not only did you mess up but you harmed the civilians, our great noble cause is in danger now because of you.",
		"You: I TOLD you there wasn't enough intel. You were the one who wanted to continue, and I ask you again Anton is it really worth the sacrifices.",
		"Ivan: good job tracking him we got good intel, now with all this intel we can have even less civilian casualties.",
		"You: One can only hope that the intel can lessen the burden placed amongst out brethen.",
		"Ivan: Guy's pretty smart to lose you so fast, but regardless we must go through the plan even with the little amount of intel we've gathered."

	"part4":[
		"Anton: Thank you and remember it was for a good cause, a revolution without money is a revolution bound to fair it pains me too.",
		"You: Robbing from the people is never a good idea, surely there must bee another way to gain money instead of robbing the people's money.",
		"Anton: Guess'll we'll hit another hopefully easier target.",
		"Anton: This is great even the people are on our side. The protest was an excellent choice of action we have gained much support amongst our country man.",
		"You: it was bound to happen, sooner or later they will see that we are indeed on the path of justice.",
		"Anton: how do we mess up a protest? We have to make them see that justice is on out side."
		"Anton: Great work on getting the weapons. As we all know the higher rank never think of the poorer people unless their lives are threaten by force.",
		"You: it was only my duty, for we require the might to fight against this military to hope that we can win.",
		"Ivan: Dang it a failed transaction. These people are driving the bargain for weapons way too high."
