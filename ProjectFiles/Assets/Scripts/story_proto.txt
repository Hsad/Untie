Anton: “Is this truly acceptable? To live under the yoke of those Cheskovan pigs, our exploits, our lives, our country subject to the mere whims of swine; is this acceptable?”
Ivan: “These are dangerous words you speak, Anton.”
Anton: “Danger means nothing in the face of the truth. I would rather die in a blaze of freedom than rot away in Cheskovan chains.”
Maria: “For forty years, we have suffered under the rule of Cheskova. For forty years, Dryovska has not been its own land. That is forty years too long.”
Anton: “Well said, Maria. We are not slaves of these filthy pigs to be ground under their vile heels. We are proud men and women of Dryovska!”
Dmitry: “Together, we can free our country!”
Ivan: “It will be risky…but some things are worth risking one’s life for.”
Anton: “Then shall we begin? Today shall be the first day of the retaking of Dryovska.”
Dmitry: “Leave the people to me! I will sway them, and turn them to our side!”
Maria: “When the time comes to fight, you will have my men.”
Ivan: “With my management, I will guarantee our success.”
Anton: “The childlike politics of those Cheskovan fools will be laid bare before me. And my subordinate here shall handle logistics and coordination. To them, he has no face, no name. Yet he is as integral to our plans as any one of us. We will disperse while he remains here. Take care, my comrades. Our revolution begins now.”
