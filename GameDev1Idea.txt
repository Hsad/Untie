Loose Character and Situation Concepts:
---------------------------------------

Location: Eastern Europe

After years of political unrest and turmoil, the Southern province of Rudoslavia has organized a strong and unified revolt.  This region has a distinct culture and history from its parent country, and has resented its annexation for generations.  With the international community sitting on its hands, it appears that the Goldovan revolt's best (and only) chance to succeed is now.

1. Sergei Bolevich
- The visonary leader of the separatist movement. An outspoken critic of Rudoslavian rule, he has worked tirelessly for years to bring the Goldovan movement to where it is today. Though pragmatic, he would rather die than see the revolution fail.

2. Alexei Kronko
- Ex-lieutenant of the Rudoslavian army and the highest ranking officer in the Goldovan region. He wished to join the military since he was a young boy. Despite the hatred of Rudoslavia instilled in him by his parents, he joined the service in the name of Goldova. He immediately jumped on board the rebellion and would like nothing more than to see the rest of the nation burn.
- EARLY: Encourages tactical military action
- LATE:  Encourages destructive military action

3. Maria Sokolova
- A widely reknowned political journalist known for her piercing criticism of Rudoslavian rule. She has published several books on the subject, and has close ties with the Goldovan media; she is also particularly hated by the Rudoslavian government.  She joined the rebellion leadership as publicist and secretary.
- EARLY: Makes the wrongs of Rudoslavian actions known
- LATE:  Begins circulating propaganda

4. Boris Starkov
- The former leader of the Goldovan's provincial government. Now that Goldova is breaking its ties with Rudoslavia, he no longer reports to his superiors in the capital. He is a politician, for better or worse, and knows how a government should be run. He isn't a huge fan of violence, and tends to talk his way around things. Mostly, though, he resents not being in charge, and complains about it frequently.  This could possibly get him killed *cough* *cough*.
- EARLY: Urges restraint
- LATE:  Creates internal conflict 

5. YOU
- You are another former military personnel, specializing in intelligence and communication. You are the lowest ranking of the commanders and are expected to carry out their orders, especially Alexei's. While you would like to see that rebellion succeed, how far are you willing to go to do that?
